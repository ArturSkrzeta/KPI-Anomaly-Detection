<p>Data input: Purchase Request numbers along with days taken to process it.</p>
<p>Methodology: Z-score.</p>
<p>With Z-score we can define outliers relying on the data background(mean, standard deviation) instead of threshold set up front.</p>
<p>With Z-score we are flexible enough to see what is the standard duration of processing PR and what is beyound the standard.</p>
<p>Outcome: script returns Puchare Requests that are related to outliers(days above standard duration) and a graph presenting outliers</p>
<p>As the following actions leaders can react and check what is the reason of processing PR longer than standardised duration.</p>
